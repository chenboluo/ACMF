# Attention Consistency Refined Masked Frequency Forgery Representation for Generalizing Face Forgery Detection


## Dependencies

* torch 1.10.0+cu113
* timm  0.4.12

More details about dependencies are shown in requirements.txt.

## Dataset Preparation

* We include the dataset loaders for WildDeepfake and Celeb-DF. You can enter the dataset website to download the original data. https://github.com/deepfakeinthewild/deepfake-in-the-wild and https://github.com/yuezunli/celeb-deepfakeforensics
* For WildDeepfake, you should first extract the facial images from the sequences and store them. We use RetinaFace to do this.

## Usage

### Training & testing

To test the model in the Celeb-DF in first stage, run the following script in your console. The model will start training and return the AUC at each epoch.
```
python test-cele.py 
```


To test the model in the WDF in first stage, run the following script in your console. The model will start training and return the AUC at each epoch.
```
python test-wdf.py 
```
